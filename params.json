Note that this library doesn't depend on a particular version of Finagle,\r\nand it has only been tested with the version below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nresolvers += \"JCenter\" at \"https://jcenter.bintray.com\"\r\n\r\nlibraryDependencies += \"com.twitter\" %% \"finagle-http\" % \"6.25.0\"\r\n\r\nlibraryDependencies += \"io.github.daviddenton\" %% \"fintrospect\" % \"X.X.X\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n###See it:\r\nSee the [example code](https://github.com/daviddenton/fintrospect/tree/master/src/test/scala/examples).\r\n\r\n###Migration Guide\r\n\r\n####v2.X -> v3.X\r\nMigrated away from the in-built Twitter HTTP Request package (com.twitter.finagle.http) and onto the Netty HttpRequest\r\n(org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http). This is to provide compatibility with the changes to the Finagle APIs in regards\r\nto creating both servers and clients. It also has the advantage of unifying the client/server interface (previously it\r\nwas different between the 2). The only things that should have to change in your code are:\r\n\r\n  - How servers are created - the new method is simpler (see the [example code](https://github.com/daviddenton/fintrospect/tree/master/src/test/scala/examples)).\r\n  - The signature of routes is now ```Service[HttpRequest,HttpResponse]```. Since the Twitter Request/Response classes\r\n   extends these interfaces, usages of the ResponseBuilder remain the same.\r\n  - Form-based parameters are now defined with the ```Form``` object, and not the ```Query``` object (which now just retrieves Query String parameters from the URL).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
